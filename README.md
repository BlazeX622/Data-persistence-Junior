Submission: Data persistence in a new repo
Now that you know how to save data between scenes and between sessions in an application, you’re ready to put those skills to use in a brand new project.
This is also a good opportunity to set up a new repo and use version control.

After you’ve implemented data persistence, please submit and share your project! Before you do, though, make sure you have thoroughly playtested it — or even better, have a friend or family member playtest it.
A successful submission will include:

    A link to your project’s GitHub repo, showing multiple commits with commit messages
    Some kind of data persistence between scenes
    Some kind of data persistence between sessions

Please take a screenshot of your project, or do a screen recording walking us through it, then post it here to share what you’ve made. 
We highly recommend that you comment on at least one other creator's submission. Did they successfully complete the challenge? What do you like about the project? What would be a cool new feature they might consider adding?
